		                  I want to inform users of this Service
		                  that these third parties have access to their Personal
		                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to

		                  guarantee its absolute security.

		                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
		                    me with personal information, I immediately
		                    delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
